## Reflection Document

### HTML

I learned a lot about html and how to structure a basic page semantically.

### Accessibility

It was very neat to learn the accessibility features of html such as ARIA and semantically correct elements. I used the solutions to check my work.

### CSS

Some of the links to assets & styles had an extra "../" that needed to be removed.  These exercises were very helpful in learning some advanced & nuanced CSS properties and styles!  I used the solutions to fix my code when issues arose, usually typos.

### Flexbox

Some of the style links had the above problem.  These exercises were helpful in learning this cool feature in CSS!

### CSS Grid

I think the grid feature of CSS is very neat!  I used the solutions to verify my code which was helpful.  This exercise was fun!

### Bootstrap

Learning Bootstrap is quite helpful & applicable to modern day work environments!  This library is very helpful at easily creating responsive web pages!  The asset image links had the same issue as above.

### Javascript

There were a lot of complex exercises for this section, so the solutions were invaluable in figuring it out.  The lab exercises were very helpful in figuring out Javascript.  Some of the links were wrong and needed fixing.

### Jquery

Fun stuff!  It is a neat library with a lot of functionality.  The css link in the dom.html needed fixing.
